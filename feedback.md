- Abstract: 4

Well written abstract!


- Introduction: 4

Great introduction.


- Background and Related Work: NA

Not in HW5


- Problem: 3.5

Good description of the data sets.  The section would have been slightly stronger if you had compared the differences and similarities of the data sets when you introduced the table.


- Solution: 3

Good overall description of your solution.  One of the goals of this section was to describe in your own words what each approach learns, which could have been elaborated.  You did a good job motivating why each was included.


- Experimental Setup: 3

You provided the train/test splits and seed information, which are important for reproducing your results.

Missing was a discussion of the hyperparamters used for each approach.


- Results: 3

Really good PO and M from the POEM, but I didn't see much in the way of E.

You missed the requested final table and subsection summarizing the results across all datasets and counting how often one method significantly outperformed, tied, or did worse than the others.

Something must have been wrong with your use of decision trees because they should have done much better (close to 100% on monks1.csv and much better on MNIST)

"As seen in graph 2 below" => it was above this paragraph :)


- Conclusions and Future Work: 4

Good summary of the paper and ideas for future work.


- Tables and Figures: 3.5

Great use of figures and tables.  I appreciated that you numbered all of them and gave them captions.

The benefit of numbering them is we can refer to them in the text so the reader knows where to look.  That would have been a great addition to your analysis.

The graphs should have been labeled with "Figure" instead of "Graph".  Also, in CS, we commonly use "chart" instead of "graph" to disambiguate from the data structure.


- Organization and Flow: 3.5

The organization and flow were pretty good, but the paper could have benefited from a transition sentence at the start of each section.  You did this well to start the Solution section, but not as well in the Experimental Setup and Results sections.
